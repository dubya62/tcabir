# TCABIR
-   Internal Representation designed for heavy optimization and parallelization


# DETAILED PLAN
-   Use website to get people to submit solutions to certain problems
-   We know that all of the solutions to a certain problem are equivalent semantically
-   Use a rule based system with these semantic equivalences to build faster code when compiling

## Specific needs
-   A compiler to compile desired languages into the IR
-   A compiler to compile from IR back to C/Cuda
-   A way to measure the performance of certain solutions or programs against certain metrics
-   A rule based system to match one piece of code to another even though they are syntactically different (normalization?)
