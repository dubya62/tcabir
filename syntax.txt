Syntax of the internal representation:

All variables must be global.
No functions allowed.
All variables are in the form #{variable number}
Allowed statements:
    if/else
    goto
    labels
    return (returns the exit code of the program)
Since the main program can accept args, there should be special syntax for cli args

Example program:

int main(int argc, char** argv){
    // print the first command line arg that starts with z
    for (int i=0; i<argc, i++){
        if (argv[i][0] == 'z'){
            printf(argv[i]);
            return 0;
        }
    }
}

Converts to
#0 = 0
@0:
#1 = #0 < #argc
if (#1){
    #2 = #argv[#0]
    #3 = #2[0]
    #4 = #3 == 'z'
    if (#4){
        write(#2)
        return 0
    }
    #0 += 1
    goto 0
}
